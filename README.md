## Introduction

The aim of Flashcards was to build an interactive app functioning completely from the command line. The project encouraged use of Test-Driven Development to test the separate classes involved, ensuring they were functional, as it was harder to "see" if they worked due to the lack of a DOM.

## Technologies

- JavaScript (ES5, ES6)
- Node.js
- Chai
- Mocha

## Gif

I unfortunately have no gif as I could not get the game to run...

## Challenges

- test logic often had to be re-written
  - early attempts at tests often forgot where data should be coming from
    - many tests would use classes not actually needed for the test file
- could not make game run from command line
  - I am not sure where to actually get the game to run and what it requires
- took too long to organize
  - felt pressured to "just write code" and didn't plan until I realized I was losing too much time
- did not complete project
  - mostly due to lack of organization in the beginning
  - likely could have reached out to other students and mentors for help more with roadblocks

## Wins

- became more familiar with use of `beforeEach()` in chai
- I have a better understanding of what needs testing
- I have a better understanding of how to properly setup, execute, and assert tests

## Comments

- I am planning to finish the project on my own time. I despise not having a completed product.
- I am pretty disappointed that I was unable to finish. Certain factors contributed to this, most of which were under my control. I need to learn to reach out for help much sooner than I did and to truly commit to planning and sticking to my plan from the get-go, particularly with an aggressive time-line for a project.
- My family has already requested a version of this to use with my niece. Therefore I need to figure out how to finish it and properly adapt it for different material.
